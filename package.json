  "description": "Our url-shortner will simply take in a URL which is arbitrarily long and shortens it to look so small so it can be shared easily.\r <br>\r ## The logic behind our URL shortener is as follows:\r - User pastes in an arbitrarily long URL to shorten.\r - We send the long URL to the server which stores the long URL into a database along with a short unique id to identify the URL ( this id is randomly generated and is usually not more than 7-8 characters long).\r - The shortened URL will be our website address with the unique id that looks something like so: ``` ajsite.com/4FRwr5Y ```.\r - When the user navigates to the shortened URL, we extract the unique id from the URL and find in the database which original long URL is associated with that id.\r - Finally, we redirect the user to the original URL from the database",
